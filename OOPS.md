# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

## 1. **Encapsulation**
### Definition
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, such as a class. It also restricts direct access to some of the objectâ€™s components.

### Example
```java
public class Account {
    private double balance;

    // Getter
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Setter
    public void setBalance(double balance) {
        if (balance >= 0) {
            this.balance = balance;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid balance");
        }
    }
}
```

### Advantages
1. **Data Security**: Sensitive data can be hidden from unauthorized access.
2. **Control Over Data**: Controlled access ensures data integrity (e.g., validation in setters).
3. **Improved Maintenance**: Changes to internal implementation do not affect external code.
4. **Modular Design**: Encapsulation promotes modularity by bundling related functionality.

---

## 2. **Abstraction**
### Definition
Abstraction focuses on exposing only the necessary details of an object, hiding its internal implementation.

### Example
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Rectangle");
    }
}
```

### Advantages
1. **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifies interaction by exposing only essential details.
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Implementation changes do not affect users of the abstraction.
3. **Flexibility**: Allows for swapping implementations without modifying dependent code.
4. **Encourages Focus**: Developers can focus on **what** an object does, not **how** it does it.

---

## 3. **Inheritance**
### Definition
Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent).

### Example
```java
class Employee {
    String name;
    double salary;

    void work() {
        System.out.println(name + " is working.");
    }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
    void approveLeave() {
        System.out.println(name + " approved leave.");
    }
}
```

### Advantages
1. **Code Reusability**: Shared logic is written once in the parent class.
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: Changes in parent classes automatically propagate to child classes.
3. **Promotes Hierarchy**: Logical grouping of related objects simplifies understanding.
4. **Extensibility**: Child classes can add specific behavior.

---

## 4. **Polymorphism**
### Definition
Polymorphism allows the same interface or method to represent different underlying forms.

### Example
#### Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

#### Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
```java
class Animal {
    void speak() {
        System.out.println("Animal speaks");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void speak() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

### Advantages
1. **Code Flexibility**: The same method name can handle different input types (overloading) or behaviors (overriding).
2. **Extensibility**: New functionality can be introduced without altering existing code.
3. **Simplified Code**: Generic code can operate on parent classes/interfaces, making it more flexible.

---

## 5. **Modularity**
### Definition
Modularity is the design principle of breaking a program into smaller, manageable, and logically independent units.

### Example
```java
class AuthModule {
    boolean login(String username, String password) {
        // Authentication logic
        return true;
    }
}

class PaymentModule {
    void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Payment processing logic
        System.out.println("Processed payment of " + amount);
    }
}
```

### Advantages
1. **Ease of Testing**: Independent units can be tested separately.
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Modular code is easier to debug and modify.
3. **Collaboration**: Teams can work on different modules simultaneously.
4. **Reusability**: Modules can be reused across different projects.

---

## 6. **Dynamic Binding**
### Definition
Dynamic binding determines which method to call at runtime rather than compile-time, allowing for flexible behavior.

### Example
```java
class Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape = new Circle(); // Runtime decision
        shape.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing a circle
    }
}
```

### Advantages
1. **Flexibility**: The decision of method execution happens at runtime.
2. **Code Reusability**: Generic code (e.g., using a parent type) works for different specific types.
3. **Improved Extensibility**: Enables polymorphic behavior, supporting dynamic systems.

---

## 7. **Message Passing**
### Definition
Objects communicate with each other by sending messages (method calls).

### Example
```java
class Order {
    void processOrder() {
        System.out.println("Order processed");
    }
}

class Customer {
    void placeOrder(Order order) {
        order.processOrder();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Order order = new Order();
        Customer customer = new Customer();
        customer.placeOrder(order);
    }
}
```

### Advantages
1. **Simplified Interaction**: Objects interact through defined methods.
2. **Improved Modularity**: Message passing encapsulates the details of how a task is performed.
3. **Decoupling**: Objects are loosely coupled as they only need to know how to send a message.

# Summary of OOP Advantages
1. **Improved Maintainability**: Modular design ensures easier debugging and updates.
2. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance and abstraction reduce redundancy.
3. **Scalability**: Polymorphism and dynamic binding allow systems to grow and adapt easily.
4. **Data Security**: Encapsulation ensures restricted access and integrity of data.
5. **Improved Collaboration**: Modular code promotes teamwork and parallel development.
6. **Enhanced Flexibility**: Abstraction and polymorphism allow easy adaptability to new requirements.

---

# Conclusion
Object-Oriented Programming principles form the foundation of modern software design. Mastering these concepts and understanding their advantages allows developers to build robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.

## 5. **Composition**
### Definition
Composition is a design principle in which an object is composed of other objects, meaning it contains them as part of its own structure. It represents a "has-a" relationship.

### Example
```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine starts");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    Car() {
        engine = new Engine(); // Car is composed of an Engine
    }

    void start() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car starts");
    }
}
```

### Advantages
1. **Flexible Design**: Allows dynamic replacement or modification of composed objects.
2. **Reusability**: Smaller components (like `Engine`) can be reused in other classes.
3. **Encapsulation**: Keeps the internal structure hidden and provides better control over behavior.
4. **Fewer Dependencies**: Reduces tight coupling compared to inheritance.

---

## 6. **Aggregation**
### Definition
Aggregation is a specialized form of association where one object "has" another object, but the lifecycle of the owned object is independent of the owner. This is a weaker relationship than composition.

### Example
```java
class Department {
    private String name;

    Department(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

class University {
    private List<Department> departments;

    University() {
        departments = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    void addDepartment(Department department) {
        departments.add(department);
    }
}
```

### Advantages
1. **Independence**: Owned objects (e.g., `Department`) can exist independently of the parent (`University`).
2. **Flexible Relationships**: Aggregated objects can belong to multiple owners.
3. **Modularity**: Simplifies design by enabling decoupled components.

---

## 7. **Association**
### Definition
Association represents a general relationship between two classes. It can be unidirectional or bidirectional.

### Example
#### Unidirectional Association
```java
class Person {
    private String name;

    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

class BankAccount {
    private Person owner;

    BankAccount(Person owner) {
        this.owner = owner;
    }
}
```

#### Bidirectional Association
```java
class Teacher {
    private String name;
    private List<Student> students;

    Teacher(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        students = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    void addStudent(Student student) {
        students.add(student);
    }
}

class Student {
    private String name;
    private Teacher teacher;

    Student(String name, Teacher teacher) {
        this.name = name;
        this.teacher = teacher;
    }
}
```

### Advantages
1. **Real-World Modeling**: Captures relationships between entities clearly.
2. **Flexibility**: Supports one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships.
3. **Decoupling**: Classes remain independent and interact via defined relationships.

## Summary of Advanced Concepts
### Composition vs. Aggregation vs. Association
| Feature       | Composition          | Aggregation         | Association         |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Strength      | Strong               | Weak                | General             |
| Lifecycle     | Dependent            | Independent         | Independent         |
| Example       | `Car` has `Engine`   | `University` has `Departments` | `Teacher` and `Student` relationships |

### Advantages of Understanding These Concepts
1. **Enhanced Design**: Helps create well-structured and maintainable systems.
2. **Reduced Coupling**: Promotes loose coupling through well-defined relationships.
3. **Better Modeling**: Reflects real-world scenarios accurately.
4. **Code Reusability**: Reusable components make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
